- **Real-time Synchronization**: Automatic sync between bot and dashboard configurations
- **Enhanced Configuration**: WebSocket handlers for vote caps and guild configuration updates

### Added
- WebSocket client for dashboard communication with automatic reconnection
- Handlers for `get_guild_roles`, `get_guild_channels`, `get_member_roles`
- Configuration update handlers: `update_vote_caps`, `update_guild_config`
- Real-time event emission: `vote_update`, `session_created/updated/cancelled`, `winner_selected`
- Auto-sync functionality triggered from dashboard configuration changes
- Enhanced logging and debugging capabilities for WebSocket operations

### Fixed

- Configuration synchronization between bot and dashboard

### Changed
- Bot now serves as single source of truth for configuration changes
- Dashboard becomes read-only for state management with bot as writer
- Enhanced WebSocket resilience with periodic connection checks
- Improved error handling and connection diagnostics

### Technical Improvements

- Improved message routing and response handling






## [1.14.3] - 2025-09-14
### Highlights (final)
- Dashboard parity and live updates foundation: bot emits lightweight events after key actions (vote_update, session_created/updated/cancelled, winner_selected) enabling the dashboard‚Äôs real-time SSE UI.
- Configuration via bot only: new WS handlers `update_vote_caps` and `update_guild_config`; emits `caps_updated`/`config_updated` so admin forms refresh automatically. Dashboard becomes read-only for state; bot is the single writer.
- Discord Event titles are sanitized to remove dates/times; localized times are shown in descriptions via `<t:...>`.
- IMDb display and sync safety: resilient display of IMDb data in posts/threads and safer Sync operations that do not revive concluded sessions.
- WebSocket resilience and clearer diagnostics across handlers.


## [1.14.3-rc13] - 2025-09-14
### Changed
- WS client: add handlers `update_vote_caps` and `update_guild_config` so dashboard delegates configuration changes to the bot.
- Emits `caps_updated` and `config_updated` events for live dashboard refresh via SSE.
- Continues the pattern: dashboard is read-only for state; bot is single writer.

## [1.14.3-rc12] - 2025-09-13
### Fixed/Changed
- Discord Events: strengthen title sanitization to robustly strip date/time words (days, months, 24h/12h times, 4-digit years). Keeps optional movie title segment only when not date-like; otherwise falls back to base title.
- Applies to both event creation and update paths via unified buildEventTitle().


## [1.14.3-rc11] - 2025-09-13
### Fixed/Changed
- Discord Events: event titles are now guaranteed to never include date/time, even if the session name contains them. Times are shown in the description using localized Discord timestamps instead.
- Event edits use the same title sanitization path as creation.


## [1.14.3-rc7] - 2025-09-13
### Fixed/Changed
- IMDb display fallback: if imdb_cache is empty, fall back to stored movie.imdb_data or perform a one-time live OMDb fetch for display only. Applies to:
  - Text post embeds and discussion thread details at creation
  - Winner announcements (text and forum)
  - Discord Scheduled Event updates after winner selection
- Sync Channels safety: avoids reviving concluded sessions by only recreating missing movie posts when an active voting session exists, and only re-adding voting buttons when a session is active.

## [1.14.3-rc6] - 2025-09-13
### Changed
- IMDb normalization (bot-side): all reads now pull from imdb_cache only; no fallback to movies.imdb_data. Future DB can omit imdb_data entirely.
- WebSocket resilience: periodic connection checks with change-only logging; auto-reconnect. Admin Control Panel shows WS status.
- Sync Channels behavior: avoids refreshing Admin Channel mirror to keep admin action buttons usable.




## [1.14.3-rc3] - 2025-09-12
### Changed
- Rename ‚ÄúViewing Channel‚Äù to ‚ÄúWatch Party Channel‚Äù across UI and DB: `session_viewing_channel_id` -> `watch_party_channel_id`
- Guided Setup and Config flows updated (buttons, selects, copy)
- Slash command renames for consistency:
  - `movie-night` -> `movienight`
  - `movie-setup` -> `movienight-setup`
  - `movie-queue` -> `movienight-queue`
  - `movie-plan` -> `movienight-plan`
  - `movie-watched` -> `movienight-watched`
  - `movie-skip` -> `movienight-skip`
  - `admin-panel` -> `movienight-admin-panel`
  - `debug-config` -> `movienight-debug-config`
- Deprecated/removed redundant commands: `movie-session`, `movie-cleanup`, `movie-stats`, `movie-help`

### Docs
- README cleanup: removed ad-hoc TODO and What's New sections; added Quick Start and Role-based Access; updated movienight-* command references
- Added ROADMAP.md to document future ideas/goals that were previously in README

## [1.14.3-rc2] - 2025-09-12
### Breaking/Changed
- Database schema: renamed `viewer_roles` -> `voting_roles`; removed `notification_role_id` entirely (clean slate)
- Removed all migrations and legacy notification role code/handlers
- Announcements now always use Voting Roles from `voting_roles` (supports multiple roles)
- Updated Guided Setup, Config UI, and permissions to use `voting_roles`

## [1.14.3-rc1] - 2025-09-12
### Changed
- Enforce Voting Roles on votes: Discord button clicks and dashboard WS `vote_movie` now require Voting Roles or Moderator/Admin
- Behavior when no Voting Roles configured: only Admins/Moderators can vote (strict enforcement)
- "Manage Server" permission counts as implicit Admin for permission checks
- Copy: ephemeral messages and logs updated to say "Voting Roles"
- Announcements now ping Voting Roles (supports multiple roles); legacy `notification_role_id` is still read as a fallback but is deprecated
- Bot Configuration menu and Guided Setup copy updated to "Voting Roles"; the in-bot "Notification Role" action now points you to the dashboard to configure Voting Roles



## [1.14.2-rc1] - 2025-09-11
### Added
- Migration 30: Backfill missing active voting session records for guilds that have pending movies but no session, and link those movies to the new session.

### Notes
- Addresses dashboards showing movies but no active session/reschedule controls for legacy servers.
- Safe and idempotent: runs once, skips if an active session already exists or no channel can be determined.
- After updating, restart the bot or run `npm run migrate` to apply.


## [1.14.1] - 2025-09-11
### Highlights (final)
- WebSocket-only integration complete; legacy webhooks removed. Dashboard‚Üíbot actions over WS now include voting, ban/unban, remove, pick winner, sync channels, and refresh panel.
- Winner selection: dashboard ‚ÄúPick Winner‚Äù triggers session finalization; forum threads update and winner announcement posts when applicable.
- Reschedule polish: session name auto-syncs to new date/time; pinned ‚ÄúRecommend a Movie‚Äù post updates accordingly.
- Reliability: improved WS reconnect logs with codes/reasons and backoff timing; numerous logging and permission polish items.




## [1.14.1-rc12] - 2025-09-11
### Fixed
- Ban behavior: prevent duplicate ‚Äúsystem/admin‚Äù rows when banning movies that already exist; only create marker rows if none exist.
- Discord cleanup on ban: archive forum threads and delete/disable text messages for banned movies.

### Improved
- WebSocket resiliency: clearer close/reconnect logging with codes/reasons and backoff timing.


## [1.14.1-rc11] - 2025-09-11
### Changed
- Webhook removal: fully removed legacy webhook server and dashboard webhook client usage; WS-only operation.
- Logging sweep (incremental): add [guild_id] context to forum post creation, movie creation debug, and session viewing join/leave + monitoring messages.


## [1.14.1-rc10] - 2025-09-11
### Changed
- WS voting (forum): also updates the forum starter message embed and voting buttons so counts reflect immediately (previously only the thread title changed).
- Permissions: Moderators can now use Remove and Skip actions in the admin movie controls; admin remains required for ban/unban/pick-winner/watched.
- Admin mirror: stop posting banned movies during Sync; banned management will live in a dedicated list/UI.
- Webhook server: removed startup; bot runs WS-only without logging the disabled webhook server.


## [1.14.1-rc9] - 2025-09-11
### Changed
- Logging: add `[guild_id]` context to WebSocket handlers and related warnings/errors:
  - vote_movie (cap checks, message updates, errors)
  - movie_status_changed updates
  - sync_guild / refresh_admin_panel
  - plan_session / reschedule_session / cancel_session


## [1.14.1-rc5] - 2025-09-10
### Changed
- Permissions: Moderators can now use the ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù button in the moderation/admin channel. Admin remains required for mutating actions (ban/unban, schedule, remove, pick winner, etc.).

## [1.14.1-rc6] - 2025-09-10
### Fixed
- Startup: fixed a missing closing brace in initializeTables() that caused a parse error near runMigrations on some Node builds.


## [1.14.1-rc7] - 2025-09-10
## [1.14.1-rc8] - 2025-09-11
### Changed
- Permissions: Moderators can now use Sync Channels and Refresh Panel buttons in the Admin Control Panel. Other actions remain admin-only.


### Added
- WebSocket voting: new `vote_movie` handler processes dashboard votes (up/down/clear), enforces per-session vote caps, updates Discord message/embed/buttons, and logs diagnostics.



## [1.14.1-rc4] - 2025-09-10
### Added
- Database: viewer_roles JSON column on guild_config
  - Ensured in base schema, initializeTables, and Migration 29 (idempotent)
  - Parsed and exposed via getGuildConfig()

### Notes
- No behavior change yet; dashboard will begin gating the Voting section by viewer roles in addition to moderators/admins.

## [1.14.1-rc3] - 2025-09-10
### Added
- WebSocket: dashboard‚Üíbot admin actions now supported over WS
  - `sync_guild` syncs Admin Panel and voting posts (forum-aware) like the webhook path
  - `refresh_admin_panel` re-renders the Admin Control Panel in the configured admin channel

### Notes
- For PebbleHost/beta, set in the bot .env:
  - `MOVIENIGHT_WS_ENABLED=true`
  - `MOVIENIGHT_WS_URL=wss://bot-movienight-beta.bermanoc.net/socket`
  - `MOVIENIGHT_WS_TOKEN=<the WS token from AWS Secrets Manager>`
- To fetch the token (read-only), run:
  - `aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id movienight-dashboard/beta/ws --query SecretString --output text`

## [1.14.1-rc2] - 2025-09-10

## [1.14.3-rc4] - 2025-09-12
### Fixed
- Sync Channel: Do not mirror queue to Admin Channel when no active session (keeps only the Admin Control Panel)
- Sync Channel: Do not recreate Voting Channel movie posts when no active session (forum: cleaned; text: show "no active session" notice only)

### Added
- WebSocket: dashboard‚Üíbot session controls over WS
  - `plan_session` creates a new voting session (Discord event + DB + scheduler)
  - `reschedule_session` updates existing session/event and reschedules voting end
- Webhook server: support `MOVIENIGHT_WEBHOOK_PORT` to bind PebbleHost-assigned fixed port (still optional; WS is preferred)



## [1.14.1] - 2025-09-10
### Added
- Asymmetric per-session vote caps to keep voting decisive and reduce "vote for everything":
  - Upvotes: max(1, floor(n/3)) where n = movies in the session
  - Downvotes: max(1, floor(n/5))
- Clear ephemeral feedback when a user hits their limit, including a list of movies they have already voted on in the session and guidance to unvote to free a slot.
- Administration panel: new "Vote Caps" configuration with Enable/Disable, Set Ratios/Min (modal), and Reset to Defaults.

- Cross-guild IMDb cache table (imdb_cache) with TTL refresh and hard-limit + LRU eviction; reduces OMDb usage. New env: IMDB_CACHE_ENABLED, IMDB_CACHE_TTL_DAYS, IMDB_CACHE_MAX_ROWS. Excluded from deep purge.

### Notes
- Caps are enforced only for movies associated to an active voting session (session_id present).
- Caps are configurable per guild via Admin ‚Üí Configure Bot ‚Üí Vote Caps. Defaults: up 1/3, down 1/5, min 1.
- Memory-only mode defaults to open voting (no caps). Database-backed mode enforces caps.


- WebSocket handlers: dashboard‚Üíbot actions now supported directly over WS
  - `ban_movie`, `unban_movie` execute immediately via DB helpers
  - `movie_status_changed` refreshes the corresponding Discord post/thread (embed + buttons) just like the webhook path
- Dashboard prefers WS automatically when connected; webhook is used as a fallback only


### Fixed
- Over-limit warning for vote caps now uses an ephemeral user message; no longer edits the public movie post.

- Recreated/synced/carryover movie posts now include IMDb details immediately (text and forum channels), rather than only after the first button press.

- IMDb calls are now avoided for carryover/sync flows; we use cached imdb_data in DB and only fetch once if missing.




## [1.14.0] - 2025-09-10
### Highlights
- Reschedule flow now uses the exact same modal as Plan Next Session with all fields pre-filled; updates Discord event, admin panel, and voting posts.
- Voting Ends (Date + Time) is optional. If omitted, voting ends 1 hour before the session start. Inputs accept 12-hour or 24-hour formats (e.g., 7:30 PM or 19:30) with validation.
- Ephemeral UX polish: success toasts auto-dismiss (~8s); confirmation prompts auto-expire (~30s); cancel flow success fixed to auto-close.
- Carryover reliability: voting buttons now reference the correct new message IDs so voting works immediately after carryover.
- Admin channel auto-syncs after session creation (including carryover) so Pick Winner / controls appear without pressing Sync.
- Discord Event RSVP tracking: every 5 minutes, Interested users are recorded per session and stored in `movie_sessions.rsvp_user_ids` (JSON column).
- Discord.js v14 compatibility and modal/timing improvements; consistent timezone handling during reschedule.

### Fixes and improvements
- Forum/text parity and robust sync across cancel, reschedule, winner, and purge flows.
- Modal handling: early defers and editReply to prevent timeouts; respect Discord‚Äôs 45-character modal title limit.
- Purge Current Queue: forum-safe operations; reuse existing system post; cleaner ephemeral updates.
- Timezone and event updates: removed "UTC" suffix from titles; update scheduledEndTime safely when start changes.
- Creation/reschedule validation, improved placeholders, and clearer field guidance.


## [1.13.0-rc129] - 2025-09-09
### Fixed
- Database: Migration 26 adds UNIQUE(movie_sessions.guild_id, id) and retries composite foreign keys to resolve errno 150 warnings on MariaDB.
- Build: refreshed package-lock.json to align with package.json versioning.

## [1.13.0-rc128] - 2025-09-09
### Changed
- Winner selection flows (Pick Winner, Choose Winner) now require an explicit confirmation step to prevent accidental session closure.
- Winner announcements and Discord Event updates now include which admin selected the winner (mentions the user).

## [1.13.0-rc127] - 2025-09-09
### Added
- Dashboard integration via secured webhook actions. New actions handled at `POST /hooks/dashboard`:
  - `sync_guild` ‚Äì sync admin panel and voting channel (forum-aware) for a guild
  - `refresh_admin_panel` ‚Äì re-render Admin Control Panel in the configured admin channel
  - `movie_status_changed` ‚Äì refresh the corresponding Discord post/thread when dashboard updates a movie‚Äôs status

### Notes
- Enable with `MOVIENIGHT_WEBHOOK_ENABLED=true`. Configure `MOVIENIGHT_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` and `MOVIENIGHT_WEBHOOK_PORTS`/`PORT` on the bot host.

## [1.13.0-rc126] - 2025-09-09
### Added
- Deps: add `jimp` for event cover image composition (16:9 poster banners) when updating Discord Scheduled Events after winner selection.

### Changed
- Event description builder now prefers stored `poster_url` and falls back to legacy `imdb_poster` field.


## [1.13.0-rc124] - 2025-09-09
## [1.13.0-rc125] - 2025-09-09
### Changed
- Reschedule: prefill event description with the existing base description only (no auto-added vote/channel/time text), preventing duplicate info when editing.
- Reschedule: best-effort cleanup of the ephemeral date/time panel after successful update.

### Added
- Webhook server (optional): built-in minimal HTTP server gated by env. Start by setting `MOVIENIGHT_WEBHOOK_ENABLED=true`. Pick port from `MOVIENIGHT_WEBHOOK_PORTS` or `PORT`. Endpoints: `GET /health`, `GET /info`, `POST /hooks/dashboard` (Bearer token via `MOVIENIGHT_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`).


### Added
- Database: added movies.poster_url column; migration backfills from stored imdb_data when available. New saves populate poster_url automatically; IMDB updates will also set poster_url.

### Changed
- Reschedule UX: no longer prompts for timezone or movie selection; it retains the session‚Äôs existing timezone and jumps straight to details after picking date/time. Movie association remains unchanged.
- Plan Next Voting Session modal: date format switched to MM/DD/YYYY (slashes) to match preference.

### Notes
- Event cover resizing relies on the jimp dependency; the code gracefully falls back to the raw poster if jimp is not installed on the host.


## [1.13.0-rc123] - 2025-09-09
### Fixed
- Reschedule session: export handler and start flow via existing creation UI; implement reschedule completion to update the existing session (name/description/time/timezone) and edit the Discord Scheduled Event instead of creating a new one. Movie post is updated accordingly.
- Removed call to missing `showDateSelection()`; now uses `showSessionCreationModal()` for date selection.
- More robust timezone handling during reschedule.


## [1.13.0-rc122] - 2025-09-09
### Changed
- Event cover image is now a composed 16:9 banner using Jimp: portrait posters are centered on a 1280x720 canvas with side letterboxing so they don‚Äôt appear zoom-cropped in Discord‚Äôs banner view.

### Notes
- Still memory-only; no tmp files. If composition or fetch fails, we fall back gracefully (description keeps the poster URL).



## [1.13.0-rc118] - 2025-09-09
## [1.13.0-rc119] - 2025-09-09
## [1.13.0-rc121] - 2025-09-09
### Added
- Event cover image: when a winner is chosen (manual or automatic), the bot now downloads the IMDb poster and uploads it to the Discord Scheduled Event as the cover image. Discord hosts the image; no persistent hosting is required.

### Notes
- Safe fallbacks: if image fetch fails or is too large, we skip setting the cover image and keep the description link.


## [1.13.0-rc120] - 2025-09-09
### Fixed
- Forum cleanup after winner/cancel: canceling a session after a winner is chosen now clears the original recommendation thread and any winner announcement threads. `clearForumMoviePosts()` now supports an option to remove winner announcements and is used by Cancel Session and Deep Purge.
- Winner flows (manual + automatic): forum mode now removes ALL movie threads (including the winner‚Äôs original) before posting the dedicated winner announcement, then resets the pinned system post to "No Active Voting Session".
- Logger TDZ: initialized logger at the top of `postForumWinnerAnnouncement()` to avoid "Cannot access 'logger' before initialization" in some code paths.

### Changed
- Discord Events: when a winner is chosen (manual or automatic), the event description now includes the IMDb poster URL when available.


### Added
- Web Dashboard messaging in initial setup, guided setup, and admin panels. Manage the bot  at https://movienight.bermanoc.net.


### Fixed
- Forum cleanup no longer deletes movie records; threads are removed and DB thread refs are cleared so movies carry over properly after cancel/winner.
- Admin Control Panel: add channel permission checks; skip and log [Missing Access] instead of erroring; startup only counts panels that were actually created/updated.
- Events: add session start time using Discord timestamp markdown (<t:‚Ä¶:F>/<t:‚Ä¶:R>) to the event description on update.

## [1.13.0-rc117] - 2025-09-09
### Fixed
- Admin panel: refresh Admin Control Panel immediately after winner selection (both paths) so Cancel/Reschedule are present until event start.
- Deep Purge: forum-aware clearing now removes winner announcement threads too (do not preserve winner during deep purge); also delete archived threads in text channels.
- Event details: enriched event update after winner with IMDb rating and synopsis in the description.


## [1.13.0-rc116] - 2025-09-09
### Changed
- README: Added ‚ÄúNext Up (1.13.x Short-Term)‚Äù TODOs covering Cancel/Reschedule persistence, ephemeral success auto-expire, guild_id logging sweep, deep purge parity, event polish, admin panel dedupe, and configuration permission docs.


## [1.13.0-rc115] - 2025-09-09
### Fixed
- Event update after winner: pass the session scheduled date to avoid "@ Invalid Date" in event titles; add safe fallback to use existing event start time if none provided.
- Admin panel timing: refresh the Admin Control Panel immediately after session creation so Cancel/Reschedule buttons are available before the first recommendation.
- Timezone: prefer `default_timezone` from guild config (fallback to `timezone`, then UTC) when creating sessions to avoid scheduling drift.


## [1.13.0-rc114] - 2025-09-09
### Fixed
- Forum winner announcement: corrected allowedMentions to avoid Discord API error (roles list only), restoring winner thread posting and role pings.
- IMDb title usage: recommendation posts now use the canonical IMDb Title when a match is selected (instead of the user-typed text).
- Discord Events: event titles now include the start time (e.g., "@ 7:30 PM"); event updates enrich descriptions with IMDb details (Year, Runtime, Genre, Rating, Plot when available).
- Admin panel UX: throttle duplicate ephemeral "Administration" panels per user (15s) to prevent multiple panels opening back-to-back.
- Deep Purge (forum-aware): after clearing threads, re-create the correct system post in forum mode (No Active Voting Session) instead of text quick action.

### Notes
- Follow-ups queued: ensure Cancel/Reschedule buttons remain available until event starts across all winner flows; optional ephemeral auto-expire/edit for success toasts; expand guild_id coverage in logs.

## [1.13.0-rc96] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Fully removed the top-level try/catch wrapper around runMigrations() to prevent parser issues on certain Node.js builds. All migration statements remain individually guarded; functionality unchanged.

## [1.13.0-rc97] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Moved generateMovieUID implementation into constructor to avoid any parser confusion with class method shorthand on certain Node builds.

## [1.13.0-rc98] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Fixed a missing closing brace in Migration 19 (fk_votes_movie catch block) that caused parser to exit class context on some Node builds.

## [1.13.0-rc99] - 2025-09-08
### Added
- Migration 21: Automated cleanup of orphaned rows (participants/attendees/movies-session links and session winner/associated references) followed by re-attempting composite FK creation. Fully idempotent and safe; does not remove valid data.

## [1.13.0-rc100] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Migration 22: Normalize column definitions (types/collations) for guild_id/message_id/session_id to satisfy MySQL FK requirements and retry FK creation. Includes diagnostics logging of actual column definitions at runtime.

## [1.13.0-rc101] - 2025-09-08
### Added
- Improve Migration 22 diagnostics: pretty-print column definitions; add MySQL version and SHOW CREATE TABLE outputs for movies and movie_sessions to pinpoint FK mismatch cause on hosts.

## [1.13.0-rc102] - 2025-09-08
### Added
- Migration 23: Add simple single-column FKs and guild-enforcing triggers as a robust fallback on MariaDB hosts. Triggers prevent cross-guild references on insert/update while keeping data intact. Idempotent creation guarded via information_schema.

## [1.13.0-rc103] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Migration 23 triggers: remove DECLARE usage and use subqueries in IF conditions to satisfy MariaDB trigger syntax rules (DECLARE must be first). This resolves syntax errors and ensures guild-scope enforcement works.

## [1.13.0-rc104] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Migration 24: Ensure movie_sessions.id is AUTO_INCREMENT and has a PRIMARY KEY on hosts where this was missing, preventing "Field 'id' doesn't have a default value" when creating sessions.


## [1.13.0-rc105] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Forum tie-break: detect forum channels and skip channel.send during tie announcement to avoid `votingChannel.send is not a function` crash; admins still receive tie-break options in admin channel
- Ephemeral IMDb selection: replace deferUpdate with update+auto-dismiss so the selection popup clears after choosing a movie

### Fixed
- Resolve syntax error in forum-channels helper (extra closing braces) causing Sync Channels to fail with "Unexpected token '}'" on voting channel sync


## [1.13.0-rc110] - 2025-09-09

## [1.13.0-rc111] - 2025-09-09

## [1.13.0-rc112] - 2025-09-09

## [1.13.0-rc113] - 2025-09-09
### Improved

- Discord Event update: include IMDb details and a link back to the configured voting channel in the event description.
- Admin tie-break posts: remove Message ID and UID from footer to reduce clutter.

### Fixed
- Recommendation modal: prevent Discord modal timeout (‚ÄúSomething went wrong. Try again‚Äù) by deferring the reply before IMDb network calls and using followUp when deferred. Also adjusted success/error paths in createMovieWithoutImdb to respect deferred interactions.

### Fixed
- IMDb selection: limit the per-row button count to Discord‚Äôs 5-component maximum by showing up to 3 results plus ‚ÄúNone of these‚Äù and ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù. Fixes Invalid Form Body error (data.components[0].components must be 1‚Äì5) when submitting recommendations.
