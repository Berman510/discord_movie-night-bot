# Changelog

All notable changes to **Movie Night Bot** will be documented in this file.

## [1.13.0-rc96] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Fully removed the top-level try/catch wrapper around runMigrations() to prevent parser issues on certain Node.js builds. All migration statements remain individually guarded; functionality unchanged.

## [1.13.0-rc97] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Moved generateMovieUID implementation into constructor to avoid any parser confusion with class method shorthand on certain Node builds.

## [1.13.0-rc98] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Fixed a missing closing brace in Migration 19 (fk_votes_movie catch block) that caused parser to exit class context on some Node builds.

## [1.13.0-rc99] - 2025-09-08
### Added
- Migration 21: Automated cleanup of orphaned rows (participants/attendees/movies-session links and session winner/associated references) followed by re-attempting composite FK creation. Fully idempotent and safe; does not remove valid data.

## [1.13.0-rc100] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Migration 22: Normalize column definitions (types/collations) for guild_id/message_id/session_id to satisfy MySQL FK requirements and retry FK creation. Includes diagnostics logging of actual column definitions at runtime.

## [1.13.0-rc101] - 2025-09-08
### Added
- Improve Migration 22 diagnostics: pretty-print column definitions; add MySQL version and SHOW CREATE TABLE outputs for movies and movie_sessions to pinpoint FK mismatch cause on hosts.

## [1.13.0-rc102] - 2025-09-08
### Added
- Migration 23: Add simple single-column FKs and guild-enforcing triggers as a robust fallback on MariaDB hosts. Triggers prevent cross-guild references on insert/update while keeping data intact. Idempotent creation guarded via information_schema.

## [1.13.0-rc103] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Migration 23 triggers: remove DECLARE usage and use subqueries in IF conditions to satisfy MariaDB trigger syntax rules (DECLARE must be first). This resolves syntax errors and ensures guild-scope enforcement works.

## [1.13.0-rc104] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Migration 24: Ensure movie_sessions.id is AUTO_INCREMENT and has a PRIMARY KEY on hosts where this was missing, preventing "Field 'id' doesn't have a default value" when creating sessions.


## [1.13.0-rc105] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Forum tie-break: detect forum channels and skip channel.send during tie announcement to avoid `votingChannel.send is not a function` crash; admins still receive tie-break options in admin channel
- Ephemeral IMDb selection: replace deferUpdate with update+auto-dismiss so the selection popup clears after choosing a movie
- Forum post duplication: remove redundant follow-up details post; initial forum starter embed now contains full info + buttons
- Event notification noise (forum mode): skip "New Movie Night Event!" message when voting channel is a forum
- System post cleanup: remove lingering "No Active Voting Session" thread once a new session begins


## [1.13.0-rc106] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Tie-break admin UI: add missing admin-mirror.postTieBreakingMovie to render tied movies with a "Choose Winner" button (admin_choose_winner:<message_id>)




## [1.13.0-rc107] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- IMDb selection buttons: truncate long labels to <= 80 chars to satisfy Discord builder validation
- Tie-break cleanup: after choosing a winner, remove tie-break candidate messages in admin channel (keep control panel)
- Sync-after-winner: avoid double-reply error by syncing admin mirror directly instead of using interaction-bound sync handler





## [1.13.0-rc108] - 2025-09-09
### Added
- IMDb selection: added explicit Cancel button to abort a recommendation after seeing results
- Forum: tie announcement now appears on the pinned "Recommend a Movie" post and gets cleared after winner selection

### Changed
- Movie embeds now show vote percentage alongside up/down and score
- Admin panel: Cancel/Reschedule buttons remain available after winner selection until the event starts
- Admin mirror: suppress "Mark Watched" button until the scheduled event start time

### Fixed
- Choosing winner via tie-break now clears forum posts, posts a winner announcement, and resets the pinned post to "No Active Session"


## [1.13.0-rc109] - 2025-09-09
### Fixed
- Resolve syntax error in forum-channels helper (extra closing braces) causing Sync Channels to fail with "Unexpected token '}'" on voting channel sync





## [1.13.0-rc95] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- Resolve startup crash on some Node runtimes by flattening Migration 19/20 structure (removed outer try/catch wrappers). All statements still guarded individually with warnings; functional behavior unchanged.


## [1.13.0-rc94] - 2025-09-08
### Added
- Event descriptions now end with a clear CTA linking to the configured voting channel: "Join the conversation and vote for your favorite movie!"
- Start-of-voting ping: when a voting session is created, the configured notification role is pinged in the voting channel
- Standalone migration script: `npm run migrate` to apply DB migrations without starting the bot

### Changed
- Removed `SESSION_UID` from Discord event descriptions (we store `discord_event_id` in DB and sync via that)

### Fixed
- Addressed a syntax issue in the migration block that could cause startup failure on some Node runtimes

## [1.13.0-rc93] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- 🧱 Migration 20: Align session_participants/session_attendees charsets to utf8mb4 (required for composite foreign keys on varchar columns)
- 🔁 Re-apply supporting indexes and add composite FKs that were missed previously:
  - session_participants(guild_id, session_id) → movie_sessions(guild_id, id) ON DELETE CASCADE
  - session_attendees(guild_id, session_id) → movie_sessions(guild_id, id) ON DELETE CASCADE
  - movies(guild_id, session_id) → movie_sessions(guild_id, id) ON DELETE SET NULL
  - movie_sessions(guild_id, winner_message_id/associated_movie_id) → movies(guild_id, message_id) ON DELETE SET NULL

### Notes
- Live DB verification shows zero cross-guild mismatches; this migration ensures MySQL can successfully create the intended composite FKs.

## [1.13.0-rc92] - 2025-09-08
### Fixed
- 🧰 Migration 19 data backfill: auto-correct legacy cross-guild mismatches so composite FKs can be created cleanly
  - Align session_participants/session_attendees.guild_id to their movie_session.guild_id
  - Null movies.session_id when it points to a session in another guild
  - Null session.winner_message_id/associated_movie_id when message refers to a movie from a different guild
- 🗂️ Added helpful indexes on movie_sessions for (guild_id, winner_message_id) and (guild_id, associated_movie_id)

### Notes
- This addresses “Foreign key constraint is incorrectly formed” warnings seen during rc91 deployment.

## [1.13.0-rc91] - 2025-09-08
### Changed
- 🛡️ Database hardening: Enforce guild-scoped uniqueness and composite foreign keys across core tables (movies, votes, movie_sessions, session_participants, session_attendees)
- 🗳️ Votes: UNIQUE(message_id, user_id) → UNIQUE(guild_id, message_id, user_id); composite FK votes(guild_id, message_id) → movies(guild_id, message_id)
- 🎬 Sessions: Composite FKs for participants/attendees → movie_sessions(guild_id, id); movies(guild_id, session_id) → movie_sessions(guild_id, id); session winner/associated → movies(guild_id, message_id)
- 🔧 API: incrementWatchCount/getWatchCount now accept optional guildId; button handler passes guildId; removeVote accepts optional guildId
- 🔁 Migrations: Added Migration 19 with idempotent guards; legacy single-column FKs dropped when present

### Notes
- All operations are now strictly guild-scoped to prevent any cross-guild data contamination.

## [1.13.0-rc90] - 2025-09-08
