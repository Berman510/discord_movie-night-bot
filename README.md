A comprehensive Discord bot for managing movie recommendations, voting, and organized movie night sessions. Features persistent voting, IMDb integration, session scheduling with Discord events, and comprehensive movie night statistics.

> **üèóÔ∏è Modular Architecture**: Clean, maintainable codebase with separation of concerns. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical details.
## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Invite the bot to your server (scopes: bot + applications.commands; see invite template below).
2. Run `/movienight-setup` and configure:
   - Movie Channel (recommendations)
   - Admin Channel (management)
   - Watch Party Channel (Discord Events + attendance tracking)
   - Voting Roles and Vote Caps
3. Plan your first session with `/movienight-plan` (Name, Date, Start Time, optional Voting End, Description).
   - If you omit Voting End, it defaults to 1 hour before the session start.
4. Members recommend via `/movienight`; everyone with permission can vote using the buttons on each movie post.
5. Admins can open `/movienight-admin-panel` to manage sessions (Plan/Reschedule, Pick Winner, Skip, Sync/Refresh).
6. Optional: Use the Dashboard to view the queue, vote, and manage sessions.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (fetch built-in).
- Discord application + bot token.
- (Optional) OMDb API key: <http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx>

### Required OAuth Scopes

- `bot`
- `applications.commands`

### IMDb Caching (cross-guild)
The bot prefers the imdb_cache table for all IMDb data. If a movie is not in cache, the bot will perform a one-time live OMDb fetch for display and attempt to cache the result when possible. This ensures posters/ratings/plots appear reliably in:
- Movie recommendation embeds (text/forum)
- Discussion thread details
- Winner announcements and Discord Event updates
- Designed to minimize OMDb usage while keeping UX complete
- Deep purge does not clear this cache

Notes:
- Set `OMDB_API_KEY` to enable the live fetch fallback
- Cache maintenance/env toggles:
  - IMDB_CACHE_ENABLED=true
  - IMDB_CACHE_TTL_DAYS=90
  - IMDB_CACHE_MAX_ROWS=10000

### Required Bot Permissions

- **Create Public Threads** (movie discussion threads)
- **Send Messages in Threads** (participate in discussions)
- **Manage Events** (create Discord events for movie nights)
- **Mention Everyone** (ping notification roles for events)

**Updated Permissions Integer:** `2147765248`

### Required Gateway Intents
In Discord Developer Portal ‚Üí Bot section, enable:
- ‚úÖ **Guild Voice States** (required for attendance tracking in Watch Party Channel)

## üìö Slash Commands

All commands use the unified movienight prefix:

  - Admin/Moderator action to plan the next voting session (opens a modal with:
    - Name, Date, Start Time, optional Voting End Date/Time, Description)
  - Creates/updates the Discord Event and pins the Recommend post.

- /movienight-watched
  - Admin action to mark the winning movie as Watched and close out the session.

Deprecated/removed commands (replaced by the above): /movie-session, /movie-cleanup, /movie-stats, /movie-help, /movie-night, /movie-setup, /movie-queue, /movie-plan, /movie-watched, /movie-skip, /admin-panel, /debug-config


## .env
Create a `.env` in the project root (copy from `.env.example`):
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
CLIENT_ID=YOUR_APPLICATION_ID
# Optional: set for additional instant command registration to development servers
GUILD_ID=YOUR_SERVER_ID
# Optional: OMDb API key
OMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_OMDB_API_KEY

# MySQL Database (get these from PebbleHost panel)
DB_HOST=YOUR_DB_HOST
DB_USER=YOUR_DB_USER
DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
DB_NAME=YOUR_DB_NAME
```

### Dashboard Integration (WS-only)
Use the WebSocket bridge (bot-initiated):
```
MOVIENIGHT_WS_ENABLED=true
MOVIENIGHT_WS_URL=wss://bot-movienight.bermanoc.net/socket
MOVIENIGHT_WS_TOKEN=YOUR_LONG_RANDOM_TOKEN
```
Note: for beta use `wss://bot-movienight-beta.bermanoc.net/socket`.

Webhook support has been removed. The bot now operates WS-only.

## Database Setup (Optional but Recommended)

### MySQL Database Configuration
The bot supports MySQL for persistent data storage. Here's how to set it up:

#### Option 1: Hosting Provider Database
**PebbleHost, Railway, Heroku, etc.**
1. Access your hosting provider's database section
2. Create a new MySQL database
3. Copy the connection details (host, user, password, database name)
4. Add them to your `.env` file
5. The bot will automatically create required tables on first run

#### Option 2: Self-Hosted MySQL
**Local or VPS MySQL installation**
1. Install MySQL on your server
2. Create a database: `CREATE DATABASE movie_night_bot;`
3. Create a user with permissions: `CREATE USER 'moviebot'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';`
4. Grant permissions: `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON movie_night_bot.* TO 'moviebot'@'%';`
5. Add connection details to your `.env` file

#### Option 3: Cloud Database Services
**AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database, PlanetScale, etc.**
1. Create a MySQL instance through your cloud provider
2. Configure connection settings and security groups
3. Add the connection details to your `.env` file

### JSON File Storage (Recommended for Small Servers)
If you don't want to set up MySQL, the bot can use a local JSON file for persistence:

1. **Automatic Fallback:** If no database credentials are provided, the bot automatically uses JSON storage
2. **Manual Enable:** Set `USE_JSON_STORAGE=true` in your `.env` file to force JSON mode
3. **File Location:** Data is stored in `movie-bot-data.json` in the bot's directory
4. **Backup:** Simply copy the JSON file to backup your data
5. **Migration:** Easy to move between servers or upgrade to MySQL later

**Perfect for:** Self-hosted bots, small servers, development, or when you want persistence without database complexity.

### Advantages of Database Mode
- **Persistent Data:** All votes, movies, and settings survive bot restarts
- **Advanced Features:** Queue management, statistics, and session tracking
- **Configuration:** Server-specific settings and admin role management
- **Scalability:** Handles large amounts of data efficiently
- **History:** Complete viewing history and recommendation tracking

- **Advanced Rules:** Per-session vote caps (up ~1/3, down ~1/5 by default) with admin-configurable ratios in the Administration panel; requires database. In memory-only mode, voting remains open (no caps).

### Memory-Only Mode (No Database)
The bot will automatically fall back to memory-only mode if no database is configured. This provides:
- ‚úÖ **Core Features:** Movie recommendations, voting, and discussions work perfectly
- ‚úÖ **IMDb Integration:** Movie details and posters still work
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Voting:** Vote counts update live during the session
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Session-Based:** Data is lost when the bot restarts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Open Voting:** Per-session vote caps are not enforced without a database (configurable caps are a database-backed feature).

- ‚ùå **Limited Commands:** Advanced management features unavailable

**Perfect for:** Testing, small servers, or temporary setups where persistence isn't critical.
